        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML is one of the key technologies of the web, by describing and creating a carefully laid out syntax HTML can describe the key aspects of a web page. In a Web application HTML can provide clear layout and semantic structure for user interfaces. Anders makes great effort to write clean and clear semantic markup that best represents the ideas behind the interface being built.</p>

        <h2>CSS3</h2>
        <p>Text might well be the core content of the internet but it is with CSS3 that a web project starts to truely come to life. CSS provides all of the aesthetic qualities of an interface, from typography and colour to measure and layout. Anders ensures he takes the time to research the latest advancements in CSS techniques. These techniques allow him to apply a designer's ideas to a cleverly coded website with accuracy and performance. </p>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Javascript is the most used programming language in the world, it is used to describe and create the behaviour of a front end application. Javascript provides a layer of interactivity that has helped to define the modern web experience. Anders' wide experience with a variety of projectshelp him to create compelling and engaging experiences. His commitment to readable and clean code help him to teach and share his discoveried with others.</p>

        <h2>HAML/SCSS</h2>
        <p>As part of the Ruby on Rails stack HAML provides a shorthand for clean and clear markup, SASS provides a variety of extensions to CSS3 including variables modules and nesting. These two combined can give a developer a great deal more power and speed when it comes to laying out and applying design to a web app. Through his experience in building web apps with Ruby on Rails teams Anders makes the most of HAML aand SASS to work quickly and efficiently.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>CoffeeScript</h2>
        <p>Coffeescript is a language that compiles into Javascript, providing some clever shortcuts and features along the way. Not only does coffeescript help to change how javascript reads and writes it also helps change the way in which a developer thinks about and describes their code. Anders is a keen CoffeeScript advocate he runs a regular <a href='http://www.coffeescriptclinic.com'>CoffeeScript Clinic</a> as well as writing and giving a variety of talks on the subject.</p>

        <h2>Responsive</h2>
        <p>Responsive Design is the idea that a site should provide the best available interface to a device, regardless of screen size. This concept is implemented in a variety of ways making use of the very best of CSS3 and HTML5. Having worked with responsive designs for many years Anders has a good appreciation of the technical requirements, working closely with designers Anders takes steps to create sites that are truely responsive. Anders also takes into account the processing power, bandwidth and pixel density of displays and makes use of appropriate technologies to give the optimum experience for every user.</p>

        <h2>Rails</h2>
        <p>Ruby on Rails is a popular development stack for creating web applications with minimal fuss and code. Kept maintained by a dedicated team, Ruby on Rails keeps up to date with the latest possibilities and techniques in web development. Anders has a fair bit of experience of all levels of Ruby on Rails Development but focusses mainly on the creation of sensible well structured templates with HAML or ERB and implementing coffeescript and SASS to provide a great front ned experience.</p>

        <h2>Wordpress</h2>
        <p>Wordpress is probably the best known blogging and CMS system, being open source and widely used it is incredibly flexible. By encapsulating all custom code within a theme sites can be developed quickly and easily by an experienced wordpress developer. Anders has spent a great deal of time creating and implementing wordpress themes that create a positive experience for the content creator/author creating bespoke interfaces within the wordpress admin system. These wordpress sites are also built with an eye to creating a great experience for the end user paying close attention to navigation that makes sense.</p>

        <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>Web Development is often seen as a solo activity, interaction between developer and screen, however like all professions web Developers find teh ned to share war stories, exchange tips and learn from the like minded. The most passionate of developers become evangelists and advocates of techniques and platforms they support. Anders has organised and run <a href='http://fesuffolk.co.uk'>Front End Suffolk</a> since January 2012 as well as speaking at a variety of events.</p>
