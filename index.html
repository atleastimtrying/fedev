        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML is one of the key technologies of the web, by describing and creating a carefully laid out syntax HTML can describe the key aspects of a web page. When itcomes to web applications html can provide key structures to interfaces. Anders makes great effort to write clean and clear semantic markup that best represents this ideas behind the interface he's building.</p>

        <h2>CSS3</h2>
        <p>Text and Images are all well and good but it is with CSS3 that a web project starts to truely come to life, CSS provides all of the aesthetic qualities of an interface. Anders makes the utmost effort to stay on top of the latest advancements in CSS techniques to help apply a designer's ideas to a cleverly coded website. </p>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Javascript is the most used programming language in the world, it can be found in nearly every computer. It's used to describe and create the behaviour of a front end application. Javascript provides a layer of interactivity that has helped ot define a modern web. Anders utilises a mixture of the experimental and tried and tested javascript to create compelling and engaging experiences.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>HAML/SCSS</h2>
        <p>As part of the Ruby on Rails stack HAML provides a shorthand for clean and clear markup, SASS provides a variety of extensions to CSS3 including variables modules and nesting. These two combined can give a developer a great deal more power and speed when it comes to laying out and applying design to a web app. Through his experience in building web apps with Ruby on Rails teams Anders makes the most of these and otehr preprocessed languages to work quickly and efficiently.</p>

        <h2>CoffeeScript</h2>
        <p>Coffeescript compiles into Javascript, providing some clever shortcuts and features on the way. Not only does coffeescript help to change how your javascript looks it also helps change the way in which a developer can approach front end development thinking in objects and classes fo cleverly describe his problem domain. Anders is a keen CoffeeScript advocate running <a href='http://www.coffeescriptclinic.com'>CoffeeScript Clinic</a> as well as writing and giving a variety of talks on the subject.</p>

        <h2>Responsive</h2>
        <p>Responsive Design has become a buzzword of late, a simple enough concept but known to be tricky to implement. The idea is that a site should provide a relevant interface to the screen size of the device it is being viewed from. Having worked with responsive designs for many years Anders has a good appreciation of the technical requirements, working closely with Designers Anders takes steps to reach a design taht can flex and bend to fit a variety of devices. Anders also takes into account the processing power, bandwidth and pixel density of displays and makes use of appropriate technologies to give the optimum experience for every user.</p>

        <h2>Rails</h2>
        <p>Ruby on Rails is a popular development stack for creating web applications with minimal fuss and code. Kept maintainedb y a dedicated team Ruby on Rails keeps up to date with the latest possibilities and techniques in web development. Anders has a fair bit of experience of all levels of Ruby on Rails Development but focusses mainly on the creation of sensible well structured templates with HAML or ERB while implementing coffeescript and SASS for some extra bang and wow.</p>

        <h2>Wordpress</h2>
        <p>Wordpress is probably the best known blogging and CMS system, being open source and widely used it is incredibly flexible. By encapsulating all custom code within a theme sites can be developed quickly and easily by an experienced wordpress developer. Anders has spent a great deal of time creating and implementing wordpress themes that create a harmonious experience for both the content creator and the content consumer.</p>

        <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>Web Development is often seen as a solo activity, interaction between developer and screen, however like all professions web Developers find teh ned to share war stories, exchange tips and learn from the like minded. The most passionate of developers become evangelists and advocates of techniques and platforms they support. Anders has organised and run <a href='http://fesuffolk.co.uk'>Front End Suffolk</a> since January 2012 as well as speaking at a variety of events.</p>
